# Workflows

The repo for Workflows that appear within Warp and within [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/)

## What are Workflows?

Workflows are an easier way to execute and share commands within Warp. They are searchable by name, description, or command and are easily parameterized.

## How Do I Access Workflows?

Workflows can be accessed within Warp directly within the app, either through the Command Palette or by pressing `shift-ctrl-r`.

All public workflows (i.e. workflows within this repo) are also available at [commands.dev](https://www.commands.dev/).

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have a workflow that would be useful to many Warp users, feel free to send a PR to add a Workflow spec.

The existing preset files should serve as an example for the format, while the a more comprehensive description of the file format is available in [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md). Please request a review from someone on the Warp team once a PR is ready for review.
